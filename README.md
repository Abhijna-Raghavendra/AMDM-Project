# IBM 322 - Course Project

### Introduction
The escalating incidence of internal attacks across computer networks has raised significant concerns among service providers. Safeguarding a computer network against malicious activities, such as unauthorized user access, including from insiders, necessitates the implementation of precise intrusion detection systems.  
The objective of intrusion detection learning is to develop a predictive or categorical model with the capability to differentiate between attacks and normal connections. These network attacks can be broadly categorized into four major types: 
-  DOS/DDOS (Denial of Service/ Distributed Denial of Service Attacks)
-  Probing
-  U2R (User to Root privelege escalation)
-  R2L (Remote to Local intruder logins)

*We hypothesize that traditional machine learning algorithms will not suffice and there exists a need for a sequential neural network architecture to achieve full classification potential.*
